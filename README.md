  This project utilizes data taken by the US Census Bureau in the fields of education, finance and industry to help government entities make better-informed decisions about the nation's policies. The R programming language was used to conduct data cleaning, preparation, exploratory data analysis, and linear regression modeling. Results were organized and presented by means of R-markdown.
